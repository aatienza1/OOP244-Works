I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

Workshop 9 seemed relatively simple. I did complete it in a quick fashion, 
however the only notable issue I had was that I had issues with the parameterized constructor of the graduate class. 
I didn't understand that even though I was using the constructor of the parent class, 
I still had to add the parameters of the parent class into the derived class. For example, I was writing my Graduate constructor as the following:

Graduate::Graduate(const char* thesis, const char* supervisor) :Student(name,age)

However I didn't understand that even though I was passing the paraeters to the parent class, that meant I had to get the parameters in the derived class' constructor.
The correct way to write it was:

Graduate::Graduate(const char* name, int age, const char* thesis, const char* supervisor) :Student(name,age)

Using Student::display(); felt a little unfamiliar and odd. I was stuck on this part of code for a bit because I was trying to use the private attribute from the Student class, and then realized I couldn't do that.
