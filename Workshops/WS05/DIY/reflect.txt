A difficult part of the lab for me was figuring out how to use a helper function. 
I did not want to use a friend, as I didn't want to give that function control over
the others. After I wrote the function I had said to myself, "that's it?" because
it seemed so simple and I commonly would over complicate the nature of it.

My biggest problem with both the lab and the DIY was overloading the >> and << operator.
It's a bit of a hard concept to understand, because I am not used to using those
operators for math equations. I found myself looking at the main.cpp a lot more than
usual to see if I was getting the correct results.

Another difficulty I had was the idea of "setting to empty" with the << and >> operator.
I could not figure out why the const and the const char* were not changing in the display. To my understanding, "setting to empty" meant setting the m_value of the Portfolio to 0, to zero, so I would only have to modify that value. It was then that I realized that I had to set the "Portfolio" object itself to empty by using emptyPortfolio();. 

I did however enjoy this workshop because it was easier for me to trace the issues with the operators over dynamic memory allocation.
