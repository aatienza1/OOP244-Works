//I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.


One of my biggest hurdles in this assignment was using the this-> operator. When I looked at the transfer function in main.cpp and I saw that the syntax was written as "!to.transfer(from)" I understood that I had to some how get the name of both trains into a function that only accepts one parameter. That's when I realized I could use the "this->" syntax which we learned from class, to say "here", as in "THIS was the train I want to use the name for". I kept getting memory leak errors while using the "transfer" function and it took a while for me to properly deallocate the memory of m_trainName within a class. My main issue is I had trouble understanding when to de-allocate the memory. I was de-allocating memory to the variable called "combinedName" when I should have been de-allocating memory to the variable that I was copying the name over to, "this->m_trainName".
