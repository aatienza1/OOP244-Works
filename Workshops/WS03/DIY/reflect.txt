//I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

My transfer function was copied by Kathlyn Lacuata.

I had quite a few hurdles during this workshop, the first was with boarding the passengeres with the load.
My main issue was there was no indication on the output that we were boarding people
on to a specific train that already had passengers loaded. You had to read the main.cpp and understand 
that the passengers were being loaded on to train A. What would happen was I would load 
the passengers on to the train but I since there was no train name in the output, I had assumed it was just any train.

My second hurdle was creating the "set" function with the three arguments. I couldn't understand why one of the trains wasn't having it's
name set, until I realized I didn't cover enough possibilities and was invalidating everything under only one circumstance. For example,
I didn't have a safe empty state for when only time was given, I didn't have a safe empty state where the name and the passengers were given, etc. 
There I learned that a safe empty state had to account for every possible scenario.

Finally the biggest hurdle was comprehending the transfer function. At first I couldn't understand how we were getting the name of the "to" train and comparing it
to the other train, until I recognized that since these were all under one class, I could still access them.
I used "this->" for more readability and so that I would guarantee that the train being called was the one inside of the class, however I do recall that
therhe are certain scenarios that you shouldn't use "this->" for like, if the argument has the same name as a variable inside of the function. However I do not
believe this is one of those scenarios.
