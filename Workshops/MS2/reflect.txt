While doing workshop 7 I found the concept of virtuality to be intersting. A lot of my errors were solved
simply by putting the word "virtual" in front of the header function. The hardest part of the workshop was
the math -- I'm not that strong at math.

For the milestone, while working on the AidMan module I found myself revisiting the Menu module a lot. I had an
issue where one of my functions in AidMan wasn't accepting a certain string, and I had to go back into Menu and 
add a default constructor, as well as go back into AidMan and change the way that constructor was as well.

I also found myself going back and fixing the getint function I had created from milestone 1. Since the function wasn't 
used, I found that I had not properly tested it. That was also something that affected me during milestone 1, as since it
was suggested to create a getint function I assumed we would be using it during that milestone.

I also had an error when trying to copy the filename into my m_filename attributed, and had to
create a separate function that would return the name to get around that.

Despite the math, I enjoyed the simplicity of workshop 7 however with milestone 2 I found myself constantly going backwards
and correcting things I had already written.
